# Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we are
# on vacation, return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays,
# the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are on vacation -- then
# on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".
# 
# alarm_clock(1, False) → '7:00'
# alarm_clock(5, False) → '7:00'
# alarm_clock(0, False) → '10:00'
