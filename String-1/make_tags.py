# The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. In this example, the
# "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay". Given tag and word strings, create the HTML
# string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".
# 
# make_tags('i', 'Yay') → '<i>Yay</i>'
# make_tags('i', 'Hello') → '<i>Hello</i>'
# make_tags('cite', 'Yay') → '<cite>Yay</cite>'

def make_tags(tag, word):
    return "<" + tag + ">" + word + "</" + tag + ">"
