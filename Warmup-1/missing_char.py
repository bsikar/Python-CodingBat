# Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has
# been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string (i.e. n will
# be in the range 0..len(str)-1 inclusive).
# 
# missing_char('kitten', 1) → 'ktten'
# missing_char('kitten', 0) → 'itten'
# missing_char('kitten', 4) → 'kittn'

def missing_char(str, n):
